BitDay Homepage
======

A website that changes based on the time of the day using the beautiful [BitDay wallpaper set](http://imgur.com/a/VZ9H2). The idea is to have a homepage site that shows the current time and changes backgrounds based on the time of the day. It's perfect for when you start up your browser, open new tabs, or if you don't have anything going on in one of your spair monitors :smile:. Checkout the images below for the different stages of the day and their corressponding hours.

## What's in the Code?

* HTML5
* SASS compiled into CSS3
* JavaScript
* JQuery

To edit CSS you will need to install SASS through RUBY. I recommend using a compiler like SassBuilder for Sublime Text which can be installed via the package control for Sublime Text.

## BitDay Wallpapers
